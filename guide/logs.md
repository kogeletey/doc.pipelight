# Log Files

## Print logs

The last 7 logs are saved in json inside **.simp/logs/** . S/O [tslog](https://tslog.js.org/).

Display last logs with the CLI.

```bash
simp logs
```

or

```bash
simp logs --verbose
```

The non-verbose "minimal" output looks actually like that.
And is likely to change for the better.
