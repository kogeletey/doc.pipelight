# How is it different from...

Following softwares and Pipelight aim to automate repetitive tasks but in different ways.

## CircleCI

Pipelight is born from Free and Open Source Softwares, it is meant to be self-hosted by organisations.
Opposed to

Dagger runs commands in containers making it more ressource consuming than Pipelight
who runs commands in a simple subprocess by default

## Drone.io

Has a Gui.

## Gitea CICD / Gitlab CICD / Github CICD

All those softwares provide an All-In-One code hosting solution.
And now that you now my affliction for big tech owned softwares.
